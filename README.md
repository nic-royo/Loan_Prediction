# Loan_Prediction 
This is my bachelor thesis for an undergrad in Computer Science at Goldsmiths, University of London.

The main object is to train a dataset with machine learning models to recognize which users will default on a loan.

To run, the following libraries must be installed:
 * pandas 
 * matplotlib 
 * matplotlib
 * numpy 
 * scipy 
 * seaborn 
 * sklearn

The Training Data.csv file contains the dataset that will be used for training and testing
The final report.pdf is a report indicating the findings of this bachelor thesis.
The file LoanPrediction.ipynb is an unfinished file where there are serious imbalancement issues.
The file FinishedPrediction.ipynb is the complete and finished project, with imbalancement issues resolved
The code_ipynb.pdf is a pdf file of the code.

The models done are the following: Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes Algorithm
