# Loan_Prediction Prototype
The main object is to train a dataset with neural networks and other methods to recognize which users will default on a loan, then test the network on a fresh dataset.

Right now, I have a done exploratory analysis and cleaning of the data, and a working decision tree classifier which I will compare to other algorithms in the future.

To run, the following libraries must be installed:
 * pandas 
 * matplotlib 
 * matplotlib
 * numpy 
 * scipy 
 * seaborn 
 * sklearn

Once these libraries are installed the code can be run, cell by cell, correctly and without problem.

Added AdaBoost, Random Forest and Naive Bayes to the predictive models. Grid search was also implemented for hyperparameter optimization.
