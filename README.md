# Loan_Prediction Prototype
The main object is to train a dataset with neural networks and other methods to recognize which users will default on a loan, then test the network on a fresh dataset.

Right now, I have a done exploratory analysis and cleaning of the data, and a working decision tree classifier which I will compare to other algorithms in the future.

To run, the following libraries must be installed:
 * pandas 
 * matplotlib 
 * matplotlib
 * numpy 
 * scipy 
 * seaborn 
 * sklearn

Once these libraries are installed the code can be run, cell by cell, correctly and without problem.
